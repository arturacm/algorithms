# Implementing algorithms

This is a study repository for implementing various famous algorithms in increasing complexity

# Algorithms

The algorithms implementing here are:

## Karatsuba Multiplication

Recursive algorithms for multiplying two large numbers. It accepts two strings with numbers and returns their product.

## Merge Sort

Famous recursive sorting algorithm. It has the time complexity of O(nlogn).
It accepts an array of numbers and returns a sorted version of it.

# Running the project

This project is created in JavaScript. In order to run it you have to manually execute each algorithm using `node`.

```
node <filename.js>
```

# Credits

These are my implementations of famous algorithms. I did not came up with the logic behind them, just learned how they work and implemented in code.
