# Implementing algorithms

This is a study repository for implementing various famous algorithms in increasing complexity

# Algorithms

The algorithms implementing here are:

## Karatsuba Multiplication

Recursive algorithms for multiplying two large numbers. It accepts two strings with numbers and returns their product.

## Merge Sort

Famous recursive sorting algorithm. It has the time complexity of _O(n log n)_.
It accepts an array of numbers and returns a sorted version of it.

## Count Inversions

Based on Merge sort, counts the inversions of the array. As a sub-product, it also returns the sorted version of the input array. Has same time complexity as Merge Sort _O(n log n)_

# Running the project

This project is created in TypeScript. The `.ts` files can be running the script followed by the algorithm file:

```
npm run start <filename.ts>
```

# Credits

These are my implementations of famous algorithms. I did not came up with the logic behind them, just learned how they work and implemented in code.
